# Disclaimer

## Important usage terms

Discoclaw is a **bridge layer** between Discord and an AI runtime (Claude Code by default). It is a convenience layer, not a safety layer. Using Discoclaw does not add guardrails beyond what the underlying runtime already provides.

- The AI runtime has full tool access to your local system — Discord doesn't change that.
- You should take the same precautions you would when running Claude Code directly: use a private server, keep the allowlist tight, and understand what tools are available.
- Discoclaw is provided **as-is**, without warranty of any kind. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) for full terms.
- The authors and contributors are not liable for any damages or losses arising from use of this software.

## Terms of Service compliance

By using Discoclaw, you agree to comply with:

- [Anthropic's Usage Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/policies/aup)
- [Discord's Developer Terms of Service](https://discord.com/developers/docs/policies-and-agreements/developer-terms-of-service)

Discoclaw does not exempt you from any platform's terms. You are responsible for how you use this software. Abuse may result in Discord banning your bot token or Anthropic restricting your account. The maintainers are not responsible for consequences arising from individual use.
