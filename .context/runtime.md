# runtime.md — Runtimes & Adapters

## Runtime Adapter Interface
- The Discord layer consumes a provider-agnostic event stream (`EngineEvent`).
- Each runtime adapter implements `RuntimeAdapter.invoke()` and declares capabilities.

See: `src/runtime/types.ts`

## Claude Code CLI Runtime (Current)
- Adapter: `src/runtime/claude-code-cli.ts`
- Invocation shape (full):
  ```
  claude -p --model <id|alias>
    [--dangerously-skip-permissions]          # when CLAUDE_DANGEROUSLY_SKIP_PERMISSIONS=1
    [--strict-mcp-config]                     # when CLAUDE_STRICT_MCP_CONFIG=1
    [--fallback-model <alias>]               # when RUNTIME_FALLBACK_MODEL is set
    [--max-budget-usd <number>]              # when RUNTIME_MAX_BUDGET_USD is set
    [--append-system-prompt <text>]          # when CLAUDE_APPEND_SYSTEM_PROMPT is set
    [--debug-file <path>]                     # when CLAUDE_DEBUG_FILE is set
    [--session-id <uuid>]                     # when sessions are enabled
    [--add-dir <dir> ...]                     # group CWD mode
    [--output-format text|stream-json]        # always passed
    [--include-partial-messages]              # when format is stream-json
    [--tools <comma-list>]                    # configurable tool surface
    -- <prompt>                               # POSIX terminator before prompt
  ```
- The `--` terminator prevents variadic flags (e.g. `--tools`, `--add-dir`) from consuming the positional prompt argument.
- Output modes:
  - `CLAUDE_OUTPUT_FORMAT=stream-json` (preferred; Discoclaw parses JSONL and streams text)
  - `CLAUDE_OUTPUT_FORMAT=text` (fallback if your local CLI doesn't support stream-json)

## Tool Surface
- Default tools: `Bash, Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, WebSearch, WebFetch` (8 tools).
- `Glob` + `Grep` are purpose-built for file search — faster than `find`/`grep` via Bash.
- `Write` enables proper file creation (previously required Bash echo/cat workarounds).
- If/when we add OpenAI/Gemini adapters:
  - Start with **analysis-only** routes (no tools).
  - Add a tool layer only if we explicitly decide we need full parity.

## Per-Workspace Permissions
- `workspace/PERMISSIONS.json` controls the tool surface per workspace.
- Loaded per-invocation from `src/workspace-permissions.ts`.
- If the file doesn't exist, falls back to the `RUNTIME_TOOLS` env var (fully backward compatible).

Tiers:
| Tier | Tools |
|------|-------|
| `readonly` | `Read, Glob, Grep, WebSearch, WebFetch` |
| `standard` | `Read, Edit, Glob, Grep, WebSearch, WebFetch` |
| `full` | `Bash, Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, WebSearch, WebFetch` |
| `custom` | User-specified `tools` array in the JSON |

Note: `Write` is excluded from `standard` tier (non-destructive). Included in `full` alongside Bash.

Example: `{ "tier": "standard", "note": "Never modify files outside workspace." }`

The optional `note` field is injected into the prompt as a soft behavioral constraint.
Custom tier example: `{ "tier": "custom", "tools": ["Read", "Edit", "Bash"] }`

## Session Scanning & Tool-Aware Streaming

Two opt-in features for better Discord UX during tool-heavy invocations:

| Env Var | Default | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `DISCOCLAW_SESSION_SCANNING` | `0` | Tail Claude Code's JSONL session log to emit `tool_start`/`tool_end` events |
| `DISCOCLAW_TOOL_AWARE_STREAMING` | `0` | Buffer text during tool execution, show activity indicators, stream final answer cleanly |

Both require `CLAUDE_OUTPUT_FORMAT=stream-json` for structured events.

## Resilience & Cost Controls

| Env Var | Default | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `RUNTIME_FALLBACK_MODEL` | *(unset)* | Auto-fallback model when primary is overloaded (e.g. `sonnet`) |
| `RUNTIME_MAX_BUDGET_USD` | *(unset)* | Max USD per CLI process. One-shot = per invocation. Multi-turn = per session lifetime |
| `CLAUDE_APPEND_SYSTEM_PROMPT` | *(unset)* | Append text to Claude's system prompt (max 4000 chars) |

**Budget semantics:** For multi-turn sessions, budget accumulates across turns and cannot be reset mid-session. Recommend $5-10 for multi-turn.

**Append system prompt:** When set, workspace PA files (SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, USER.md, TOOLS.md) are skipped from the context file list (their content is already in the system prompt). Base context files (core.md, discord.md, safety.md etc.) and channel-specific context are unaffected. **Note:** Do not set this on first run before `workspace/BOOTSTRAP.md` has been consumed — the skip logic also bypasses BOOTSTRAP.md loading.

- **Session scanner** (`src/runtime/session-scanner.ts`): watches `~/.claude/projects/<escaped-cwd>/<session-id>.jsonl`, skips pre-existing content, degrades gracefully if the file never appears.
- **Tool-aware queue** (`src/discord/tool-aware-queue.ts`): state machine that suppresses narration text before tools, shows human-readable activity labels (from `src/runtime/tool-labels.ts`), and streams the final answer after all tool use completes.
- **Tool labels** (`src/runtime/tool-labels.ts`): maps tool names to labels like "Reading .../file.ts", "Running command...", etc.

## Multi-Turn (Long-Running Process)

Opt-in feature that keeps a long-running Claude Code subprocess alive per Discord session key using `--input-format stream-json`. Follow-up messages are pushed to the same process via stdin NDJSON, giving Claude Code native multi-turn context (tool results, file reads, edits persist across turns).

| Env Var | Default | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `DISCOCLAW_MULTI_TURN` | `1` | Enable long-running process pool |
| `DISCOCLAW_MULTI_TURN_HANG_TIMEOUT_MS` | `60000` | Kill process if no stdout output for this long |
| `DISCOCLAW_MULTI_TURN_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` | `300000` | Kill idle process after 5 min of no messages |
| `DISCOCLAW_MULTI_TURN_MAX_PROCESSES` | `5` | Max concurrent long-running processes |

Key files:
- **Long-running process** (`src/runtime/long-running-process.ts`): manages a single subprocess with state machine (`idle` -> `busy` -> `idle` or `dead`), hang detection, idle timeout.
- **Process pool** (`src/runtime/process-pool.ts`): pool of `LongRunningProcess` instances keyed by session key, with LRU eviction.

Behavior:
- When enabled, `invoke()` tries the long-running process first for any call with a `sessionKey`.
- On hang detection or process crash, automatically falls back to the existing one-shot mode (unchanged).
- On shutdown, `killActiveSubprocesses()` cleans up the pool.

Known limitations:
- GitHub issue #3187 reports that multi-turn stdin can hang after the first message. Mitigated by automatic hang detection + fallback.
- Prompt construction is unchanged (full context sent every turn). Optimizing to skip redundant context is a follow-up.

## Image Input (Discord → Claude)

When a Discord message or reaction target has image attachments (PNG, JPEG, WebP, GIF), they are downloaded and sent to Claude Code as base64-encoded image content blocks via `--input-format stream-json` stdin.

### How it works

1. **Filtering** — `resolveMediaType()` checks the attachment's `contentType` (lowercased) or falls back to file extension. Non-image attachments are surfaced as plain URLs in the prompt text.
2. **Validation** — Host allowlist (`cdn.discordapp.com`, `media.discordapp.net`), HTTPS-only, redirect rejection (`redirect: 'error'`), per-image and total size caps.
3. **Download** — `downloadAttachment()` fetches the image with a 10 s timeout, post-checks actual size, and returns base64.
4. **Delivery** — The runtime adapter writes a `stream-json` stdin message containing `[{ type: 'text', text: prompt }, { type: 'image', source: { type: 'base64', ... } }, ...]`. When images are present, `--output-format` is forced to `stream-json` regardless of the configured format.

### Security controls

| Control | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Host allowlist | Only Discord CDN hosts are permitted (SSRF protection) |
| HTTPS only | HTTP URLs are rejected |
| Redirect rejection | `fetch()` uses `redirect: 'error'` — no following redirects to internal hosts |
| Per-image size cap | 20 MB (`MAX_IMAGE_BYTES`), checked from metadata pre-download and from buffer post-download |
| Total size cap | 50 MB across all images in one message (`MAX_TOTAL_BYTES`) |
| Per-invocation cap | 10 images (`MAX_IMAGES_PER_INVOCATION`) |
| Download timeout | 10 s per image (`DOWNLOAD_TIMEOUT_MS`) |
| Filename sanitization | Control chars stripped, truncated to 100 chars in error messages |

### Key files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `src/discord/image-download.ts` | Download, validate, base64-encode Discord attachments |
| `src/runtime/claude-code-cli.ts` | Stdin pipe construction, `effectiveOutputFormat` override |
| `src/discord.ts` | Message handler: download images, pass to runtime, images only on initial turn |
| `src/discord/reaction-handler.ts` | Reaction handler: same download flow, also surfaces non-image attachment URLs |

### Follow-up depth gating

Images are only sent on the initial invocation (`followUpDepth === 0`). Auto-follow-up turns (triggered by query actions) are text-only — re-downloading images would waste time and bandwidth.

## Image Output (Claude → Discord)

Any `image` content block in Claude Code's stream-json output is automatically captured and delivered as a Discord file attachment. Claude models don't natively generate images — images only appear when an MCP tool returns image content blocks.

### How it works

1. **Extraction** — `extractImageFromUnknownEvent()` in `claude-code-cli.ts` recognizes direct `{ type: 'image', source: { type: 'base64', media_type, data } }` blocks and `content_block_start` wrappers. `extractResultContentBlocks()` handles result events containing mixed text + image arrays.
2. **Dedup** — `imageDedupeKey()` builds a key from media type + base64 length + 64-char prefix. Each consumer tracks a `Set<string>` of seen keys so duplicates (common with multi-turn mirrors) are dropped.
3. **Delivery** — `buildAttachments()` in `output-common.ts` converts each `ImageData` to a Discord `AttachmentBuilder` (named `image-1.png`, etc.). The three consumer paths — message (`discord.ts`), reaction (`reaction-handler.ts`), and cron (`executor.ts`) — all collect images into an `ImageData[]` during streaming and pass them to the shared send helpers.

### Key files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `src/runtime/types.ts` | `ImageData` type, `image_data` EngineEvent variant |
| `src/runtime/claude-code-cli.ts` | Extraction, dedup key, per-invocation image counting |
| `src/runtime/long-running-process.ts` | Multi-turn mirror: dedup + emit for long-running sessions |
| `src/discord/output-common.ts` | `buildAttachments()`, attachment slicing across message chunks |
| `src/discord.ts` | Message path consumer |
| `src/discord/reaction-handler.ts` | Reaction path consumer |
| `src/cron/executor.ts` | Cron path consumer |

### Limits

| Limit | Value | Source |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Max base64 size per image | 25 MB | `MAX_IMAGE_BASE64_LEN` |
| Max images per invocation | 10 | `MAX_IMAGES_PER_INVOCATION` |
| Max attachments per Discord message | 10 | Discord API limit |

### Enabling image generation

Since Claude can't generate images directly, you need an MCP server that wraps an external image API (DALL-E, Replicate, Stability, etc.).

1. **Set up an MCP server** that exposes a tool (e.g. `generate_image`) returning an `image` content block with `{ type: 'base64', media_type, data }`. Any MCP server that returns image content blocks will work — the pipeline is format-driven, not tool-name-driven.
2. **Register it** in the workspace `.mcp.json` so Claude Code loads it on invocation.
3. **Add workspace instructions** (in `workspace/SOUL.md` or system prompt) telling the bot it can generate images and when to use the tool.

The rest is automatic: the runtime adapter extracts the image blocks, deduplicates them, and the Discord layer attaches them to the reply.
