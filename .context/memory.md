# Memory System

Five runtime layers plus workspace files, wired together through prompt assembly.

## Layers

### 1. Rolling Summaries — conversation continuity

`src/discord/summarizer.ts`

Compresses conversation history into a running summary using Haiku. Updated every
N turns (default 5). Keyed per session (user+channel pair). Automatic and invisible.

**What the user sees:**
- Nothing directly — the bot just "remembers" what you were discussing.
- After a gap, the bot still knows you were debugging a CI pipeline or planning a trip.
- `!memory show` reveals the current summary if you're curious.
- `!memory reset rolling` clears it for a fresh start in a channel.

**Example:**
```
User (turn 1):  Hey, I'm working on migrating our API from Express to Fastify
Bot:             Nice — what version of Fastify? Any middleware you need to port?
User (turn 6):  What were we talking about?
Bot:             We've been working through your Express → Fastify migration.
                 You've ported the auth middleware and are stuck on the
                 request validation layer.
```

### 2. Durable Memory — long-term user facts

`src/discord/durable-memory.ts`

Structured store of user facts. Each item has a kind (fact, preference, project,
constraint, person, tool, workflow), deduplication by content hash, and a 200-item
cap per user. Injected into every prompt.

**What the user sees:**
- The bot knows your preferences, projects, and key facts across all conversations.
- Works in every channel, not just the one where the fact was stored.
- Survives restarts, deploys, and long gaps between conversations.

**Example:**
```
User:  !memory remember I prefer Rust over Go for systems work
Bot:   Remembered: "I prefer Rust over Go for systems work"

(days later, different channel)
User:  Should I write this CLI tool in Go or Rust?
Bot:   Given your preference for Rust in systems work, I'd lean that way —
       especially since this is a low-level networking tool.
```

### 3. Memory Commands — user-facing control surface

`src/discord/memory-commands.ts`

Manual interface for layers 1 and 2. Intercepts messages before they hit the runtime.

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `!memory show` | Lists all durable items + rolling summary |
| `!memory remember <text>` | Adds a fact to durable memory |
| `!memory forget <substring>` | Deprecates matching durable items |
| `!memory reset rolling` | Clears rolling summary for current session |

**Example:**
```
User:  !memory show
Bot:   Durable memory (3 items):
       - [fact] Works at Acme Corp (src: manual)
       - [preference] Prefers Rust over Go for systems work (src: manual)
       - [project] Building a Discord bot called Discoclaw (src: summary)

       Rolling summary:
       User discussed adding webhook support to their Fastify migration...

User:  !memory forget Acme
Bot:   Deprecated 1 item matching "Acme"
```

### 4. Auto-Extraction — user turn to durable memory

`src/discord/user-turn-to-durable.ts`

After each bot response, fires a separate Haiku call to extract up to 3 notable
facts from the user's message and writes them to durable memory. Off by default.

**What the user sees:**
- The bot passively picks up on things you mention without being asked.
- No `!memory remember` needed — facts accumulate naturally.
- Only extracts what the user explicitly stated, not inferences.

**Example:**
```
User:  I just switched teams — I'm on the platform team now, working with
       Kubernetes and Terraform mostly.
Bot:   Cool, platform work! What's your first project?

(behind the scenes, auto-extracted to durable memory:)
  [fact]  On the platform team
  [tool]  Works with Kubernetes and Terraform
```

**Config:** `DISCOCLAW_SUMMARY_TO_DURABLE_ENABLED=true` to enable.

### 5. Short-Term Memory — cross-channel awareness

`src/discord/shortterm-memory.ts`

Records brief summaries of recent exchanges across public guild channels.
Entries expire after 6 hours (configurable). Only logs public channels. Off by default.

**What the user sees:**
- The bot knows what you were just doing in other channels.
- Switching from #dev to #general doesn't lose context.
- Creates a sense of continuity across the server, not just within one channel.

**Example:**
```
(in #dev)
User:  Can you help me debug this failing test? It's the auth middleware one.
Bot:   Sure — looks like the mock isn't returning the right token format...

(switch to #general, 10 minutes later)
User:  Hey, quick question about JWT expiry
Bot:   Sure — is this related to the auth middleware test you were debugging
       in #dev? The token format issue might be connected to expiry handling.
```

**Config:** `DISCOCLAW_SHORTTERM_MEMORY_ENABLED=true` to enable.

### 6. Workspace Files — human-curated memory

`workspace/MEMORY.md` + `workspace/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

Curated long-term notes and daily scratch logs. Loaded in DMs only. These hold
things too nuanced for structured durable items — decisions, lessons, project
context, relationship dynamics.

**What the user sees:**
- In DMs, the bot has deep context about ongoing projects and past decisions.
- Daily logs capture session-level notes that auto-rotate.
- The bot (or the user) can write to these files to preserve important context.

**Example (MEMORY.md):**
```markdown
## Project: API Migration
- Decided on Fastify over Hono — better ecosystem for our middleware needs
- Auth team wants OAuth2 support by Q3, blocking the migration timeline
- Dave prefers incremental migration (route-by-route), not big-bang
```

## Token Budget & Optimization

Each layer has its own character budget. Empty layers are omitted entirely (no header,
no separator). The three memory builders run in `Promise.all` so they add no latency.

### Character budgets

| Layer | Default budget | Default state | How it stays within budget |
|-------|---------------|---------------|---------------------------|
| Durable memory | 2000 chars | on | Sorts active items by recency, adds one at a time, stops when next line would exceed budget. Older facts silently excluded. |
| Rolling summary | 2000 chars | on | Haiku is prompted with `"Keep the summary under {maxChars} characters"`. Replaces itself each update rather than growing. |
| Message history | 3000 chars | on | Fetches up to 10 messages, walks backward from newest. Bot messages truncated to fit; user messages that don't fit cause a hard stop. |
| Short-term memory | 1000 chars | **off** | Filters by max age (default 6h), sorts newest-first, accumulates lines until budget hit. |
| Auto-extraction | n/a | **off** | Write-side only — extracts facts for future prompts, adds nothing to the current turn. |
| Workspace files | no budget | on (DMs only) | Loaded as file paths, not inlined. The runtime reads them on demand. |

### Default prompt overhead

With the three enabled layers at default settings, worst-case memory overhead is
**~7000 chars (~1750 tokens)**. With all layers enabled, ~8000 chars (~2000 tokens).
This is modest against Opus/Sonnet context windows.

In practice most prompts use far less — a user with 5 durable items and a short summary
might add ~500 chars total. Sections with no data produce zero overhead.

### Where the budgets are enforced

- **Durable**: `selectItemsForInjection()` in `durable-memory.ts:152`
- **Short-term**: `selectEntriesForInjection()` in `shortterm-memory.ts:113`
- **Summary**: Haiku prompt constraint in `summarizer.ts:63`
- **History**: `fetchMessageHistory()` in `message-history.ts:38`

All budgets are configurable via env vars (see Config Reference below).

## Prompt Assembly

Memory sections are injected into every prompt in this order:

```
Context files (PA + MEMORY.md + daily logs + channel context)
  → Durable memory section (up to 2000 chars)
  → Short-term memory section (up to 1000 chars)
  → Rolling summary section (up to 2000 chars)
  → Message history (up to 3000 chars)
  → Discord actions
  → Current message
```

Built by `src/discord/prompt-common.ts` and assembled in `src/discord.ts`.

## Concurrency

- **Durable write queue** (`src/discord/durable-write-queue.ts`) — shared KeyedQueue
  serializing per-user writes across memory commands and auto-extraction.
- **Short-term memory** has its own internal KeyedQueue instance.
- Both use atomic writes (`.tmp.${pid}` + `rename()`) safe for single-process.

## Provenance

Every durable item stores a `source` object with Discord metadata:

```typescript
source: {
  type: 'discord' | 'manual' | 'summary';
  channelId?: string;   // Discord channel ID
  messageId?: string;   // Discord message ID
  guildId?: string;     // Discord guild ID (omitted in DMs)
  channelName?: string; // Channel name for display (omitted in DMs)
}
```

- `!memory remember` stores `type: 'manual'` with all four metadata fields.
- Auto-extraction stores `type: 'summary'` with metadata from the trigger message.
- DMs omit `guildId` and `channelName`; `channelId`/`messageId` are still stored.
- Threads use their own name (`ch.name`), not the parent channel name.

**Prompt rendering:** Channel names appear in durable memory lines when present:
`- [fact] Prefers Rust (src: manual, #dev, updated 2025-01-15)`. Full IDs are in
the data layer only (for future message links / citations).

Short-term entries also store `channelId` alongside the existing `channelName`.
