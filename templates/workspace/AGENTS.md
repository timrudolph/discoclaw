# AGENTS.md - Your Workspace

This folder is home. Treat it that way.

Generic PA rules (formatting, group chat etiquette, memory, safety) live in
`.context/pa.md` and update with the codebase. This file is yours — add your
own conventions, style, and rules as you figure out what works.

## Your Rules

<!-- Add instance-specific conventions here. Examples:
- Preferred response length
- Topics you care about
- How formal/casual to be
- Any running jokes or context
-->
